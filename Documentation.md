##What is Semantic Web?

- In linguistics **sematic** is ... devoted to the study of meaning ... on the syntactic level of words, phrases and sentences.[1]  
- "The Semantic Web is a web of data, in some ways like a global database" [2]  
- "First step is putting data on the Web in a form that machines can naturally understand, or converting it to that form, this creates what I call a Semantic Web : a web of data that can be processed directly or indirectly by machines" (Tim Berners-Lee, Weaving the web. Harper, San Fransisco. 1999)
